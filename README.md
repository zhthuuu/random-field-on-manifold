# random-field-on-manifold
An FEM based approach to generate isotropic/anisotropic Gaussian/non-Gaussian random field on 2d manifold (with trimesh) or 2d plane surface (with trimesh and grid mesh). 

Notice that if the random field is generated on the manifold, there will be no boundary effects - abnormal covaraince structure occured on the boundary, as observed on plane domains, such as square or circle, because there is no boundary on the 2d manifold. Details of boundary effect can see paper 'An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach'
