# random-field-on-manifold
An FEM based approach to generate isotropic/anisotropic Gaussian/non-Gaussian random field on 2d manifold or 2d plane surface. 

This code can also be extended to generate isotropic/anisotropic Gaussain random field with minor modification (needs to be developed by yourself).
